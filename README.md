## üìå Project Overview  
This project investigates the role of **political indicators** in predicting stock index returns in **ASEAN markets** (Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand). Using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network, the study compares models with and without political indicators to determine their predictive value.  

Data spans **2000‚Äì2022**, with training (2000‚Äì2017) and testing (2018‚Äì2022) periods, enabling evaluation across different market conditions, including crises and recoveries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  
- **Model:** LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time series forecasting  
- **Inputs:**  
  - Political indicators from the World Bank‚Äôs Worldwide Governance Indicators (Voice & Accountability, Political Stability, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, Control of Corruption)  
  - Economic indicators from the Asian Development Bank  
  - Lagged index returns (1‚Äì3 periods)  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** MSE, RMSE, MAPE  
- **Feature Importance:** Permutation Feature Importance  
- **Statistical Testing:** One-way ANOVA with Tukey‚Äôs HSD

## üìä Key Findings  
- Including political indicators significantly improved predictive accuracy:  
- Most influential political indicators: **Political Stability, Control of Corruption, Government Effectiveness**.  
- **Country differences:** Thailand and Indonesia showed the highest sensitivity to political factors, reflecting their turbulent political histories.  
- Results highlight the importance of governance and political stability for **financial market performance** in emerging economies.

## üõ† Tech Stack  
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- **Data Sources:**  
  - World Bank ‚Äì Worldwide Governance Indicators  
  - Asian Development Bank ‚Äì Key Indicators Database  
  - Wharton Research Data Services ‚Äì Monthly World Indices
